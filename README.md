# user-yum.sh

A yum &amp; rpm package installer for CentOS, RedHat RHE, Fedora and the likes, operating at user-privilege.

If you want to know how it works, have a look at [How to install packages in Linux (CentOS) without root user with automatic dependency handling?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52567731/2514354). If you just want to install a few packages, you may want to use the above answer rather than **user-yum.sh**.

## Usage

### Installing a package

Downloading one or several package:

```sh
make +screen
make +zsh +tcl
```

Installing all downloaded packages:

```sh
make install
```

### Help to setup

Printing the lines to add to your .rc:

```sh
make environment
```

You can also use `make env`. It is a short alias for `make environement`.

This will output a block of text like the following (2018-09-29):

```sh
# Setting environment for /home/mc/y
ROOT_D="/home/mc/y"

PATH="$ROOT_D/usr/sbin:$ROOT_D/usr/bin:$ROOT_D/bin:$PATH"

L="/lib:/lib64:/usr/lib:/usr/lib64"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$L:$ROOT_D/usr/lib:$ROOT_D/usr/lib64"
```

Tip: You can source it using process substitution if you like:

```sh
source <(cd user-yum.sh/ && make env)
```

`eval "$(cd user-yum.sh/ && make env)"` works too. Actually, it even compatible with
dash, while `source <(cd user-yum.sh/ && make env)` isn't.

Remove the root install folder (`$ROOT_D`) to remove all installed packages.

There is currently no way to remove a package from the directory after running
`make install` so be careful: use backup or use several instances. If you've
just happend to mistype `make +the_wrong_name` you can use `make unload` to
clean the cache (/rpm) and the list of downloaded packages (/dwnldlist).

## Helper script

If you don't want to `cd` into `user-yum.sh` to install packages, you can use the
wrapper helper script `em.sh` (usEr-yuM), which will cd into the right directory
before making your command. If you use it, the priviously mentionned commands become:

```sh
em.sh +screen
em.sh +zsh +tcl
```

```sh
em.sh install
```

```sh
source <(user-yum.sh/em.sh env)
```

## Configuration

### Root directory

You should configure the `ROOT_D` value in the Makefile to your liking. The
default is (as of 2019-01-29) (was?):

```sh
ROOT_D := root
```

### Install flag

You may want to remove the + prefixing the name of the packages to install. If
so, change the `INSTALL_FLAG_PREFIX`, from

```sh
INSTALL_FLAG_PREFIX := +
```

to

```sh
INSTALL_FLAG_PREFIX :=
```
